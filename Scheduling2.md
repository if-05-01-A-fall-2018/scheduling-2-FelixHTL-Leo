# Assignment 8: Scheduling


1. **Multiple Queues**

  It needs 5 swaps wihtin the first one.

2. **Shortest Process Next**

    A: 142,5
    B: 102,5
    So the shortest is B.

3. **CPU-bound and I/O-bound Processes**

  CPU-Bound Processes need more qauntas but do not get as much processing time as I/O-Bound process. It needs less quantas but has to have more often a process time due to the fact that it has to be responsible in every moment.

4. **Real Time Schedulable**

  Σ C3/P3 = 0,95 ≤ 1
  0,95 + x/250 <= 1
  x <= 12,5

  For $x$ is the highest possible number 12,5.
